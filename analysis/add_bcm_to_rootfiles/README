We need to use R__LOAD_LIBRARY to load the ScalerCalib library. 

First, go to ~/CT12Gev/ct_replay/CALIBRATION/bcm_current_map and build it:
> root -b
root [0] .L ScalerCalib.C+
root [1] .q

Then to make it accessible here, link it:
> ln -s ~/CT12Gev/ct_replay/CALIBRATION/bcm_current_map/ScalerCalib_C.so ScalerCalib_c

Now you can run 01_create_all_bcm_params.sh

After that, you should run XYZ to add these params to your production replay rootfiles.
