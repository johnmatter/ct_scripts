Thoughts from Mark on the fact that for some runs (Q2=14, LH2 in particular) we have more EDTM counts than pTRIG6!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scaler_EDTM = number of EDTM pulses produced by the 3Hz clock
            = time_tot * 3 Hz
This is not effected by computer or electronic livetime.

N_ev6_EDTM = number of EDTM pulses which are input to the trigger module as event 6. 

Since the electronic deadtime of the trigger circuit ELT eliminates a fraction of the initial EDTM pulses, we have
N_ev6_EDTM = Scaler_EDTM * ELT

N_ev6_phys = number of physics coincidence triggers that go into the trigger module.

The scaler, Scaler_ev6, that counts the total number of input trig6 to the trigger module is
Scaler_ev6 = N_ev6_phys + N_ev6_EDTM
           = N_ev6_phys + (Scaler_EDTM * ELT)

Suppose that for a run of length time_tot, the following inequality is true.
Scaler_EDTM/time_tot > Scaler_ev6/time_tot
                     > N_ev6_phys/time_tot + (Scaler_EDTM/time_tot) * ELT

R_E = Scaler_EDTM/time_tot = 3 Hz
R_P = N_ev6_phys/time_tot = R_true_coin + R_hms_single*R_shms_single*100ns

R_E > R_P + R_E*ELT

R_E*(1-ELT) > R_P

This is the condition for having more scaler counts for the EDTM than for pTRIG6.
So for example if ELT = 0.9 is R_P < 0.3 Hz then the Scaler_EDTM will be greater than the Scaler_ev6
The CT R_P was low and it could have be less than 3Hz*(1-ELT).

R_P would be the (ACC_ev6 - ACC_EDTM_ev6)/tot_time, which also gives you a measure of the ELT

The ELT is also proportional to the R_shms_single rate so there could be
some interplay between running at different current and whether this
inequality is met.
